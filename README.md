At Princeton, you will be among the best, brightest and most creative talents of your generation. ORFE is a small and friendly department---please do introduce yourself to fellow students and to faculty when you see them. We are very happy that you chose to join us,and we look forward to learning about your research and ideas in thecoming years.

## Message from the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS)

### Professor Mykhaylo Shkolnikov

It is my great pleasure to welcome you to ORFE! ORFE combines Financial Mathematics, Machine Learning, Operations Research, Optimization, Probability and Statistics under one roof and it is my hope that you will thrive in this stimulating interdisciplinary environment. Please feel free to reach out for advice on academic matters as you progress through the various stages of Graduate School.

## PhD Program Requirement Summary

In the first year, students sign up for the six core courses in optimization, probability and statistics, followed by a qualifying exam at the end of the summer, if required. In addition, at least two advanced courses and two semesters of directed research are completed under the direction of a faculty adviser in the student's area of interest by the end of the second year in preparation for the general examination. The general examination is taken in the spring of the second year of study. Usually, beyond the general examination, two to three years are needed for the completion of a suitable dissertation. Upon completion of thesis studies and acceptance of the dissertation by the department and the Graduate School, the candidate is admitted to the final public oral examination.

In the first year of graduate study, students must take all six core courses.

*Please note that core courses cannot be dropped without DGS approval*.

### Core courses

* ORF 522 Linear & Nonlinear Optimization
* ORF 523 Convex and Conic Optimization
* ORF 524 Statistical Theory and Methods
* ORF 525 Statistical Foundations of Data Science
* ORF 526 Probability Theory
* ORF 527 Stochastic Calculus

### Qualifying exams

Qualifying exams are held in September of the second year. Students can place out of the qualifying exams by receiving at least an A- in four of the core classes.

- All Ph.D. and M.S.E. candidates are required to take EGR501 before the end of their second year. This is a half-semester course that will educate graduate students in engineering in the responsible conduct of research. The lectures provide theoretical background information as well as case studies about ethics in day-to-day research situations, publishing and peer-reviewing, student-adviser relationships, collaborative research, as well as in the big picture and considerations of long-term impact. Students are provided resources to consult when faced with ethical questions. The theoretical concepts are made relevant via small-group discussions in departmental and research field-specific precepts. The course is graded on a pass/fail basis.
- ORF 509 & 510: Before taking the general exams, Ph.D. students must complete two research projects under the supervision of a faculty belonging to ORFE or associated to ORFE. Students are required to submit a written report on the findings in both projects. The results of ORF 510 are presented in the oral part of the general exam.
- General exam (at the end of the second year)
- Research dissertation and Final Public Oral Exam (FPO)

In addition, students take a number of additional classes. At least two of these classes at the 500 level (not including Seminars) must be passed with at least a B+ requirement to pass the general exam. These two advanced courses can be chosen from the following list of relevant classes:

- ORF 504 Financial Econometrics
- ORF 505 Statistical Analysis of Financial Data
- ORF 531 Computational Finance in C++
- ORF 534 Quantitative Investment Management
- ORF 535 Financial Risk Management
- ORF 538 PDE Methods in Financial Mathematics
- ORF 542 Stochastic Control and Stochastic Differential Games
- ORF 544 Stochastic Optimization
- ORF 550 Topics in Probability: Probability in High Dimension
- ORF 554 Markov Processes
- ORF 565 Empirical Process and Asymptotic Statistics
- ORF 569 Special Topics in Statistics, Operations Research and Financial Engineering (e.g., Theory and Practice of Deep Learning, Probabilistic Theory of Network Games and Mean Field Interactions, Topics in Game Theory)

- PHY 521/MAT 597 Introduction to Mathematical Physics

### Research and Thesis Adviser

The core classes are there to establish a solid foundation with tools required for research in the disciplines covered by the department. The funding provided by the university for the first year provides freedom and time for students to acclimate to the new environment of graduate school and to make a wise choice of research direction and adviser. Some may know early on the direction they wish to pursue, but for many, it is worth exploring a number of classes taught by a variety of professors before deciding.

The directed classes ORF 509 and 510 should be taken with a faculty adviser with a grade received for 509 by the time of the general exams. The grade for 510 counts as the oral general exam grade. Some take these classes in the spring of the first year and fall of the second year. Others take 509/510 in the fall and spring of the second year.

The department is small and there is plenty of opportunity to meet and talk with faculty about research interests. Please be pro-active in doing so as you discover your areas of interest. At various times, some faculty might simply be too busy to take on new students: do not take it personal if a faculty member is unable to take you on as an advisee, there are plenty of excellent research opportunities available to you. If a student works with a faculty adviser who is not a member of the ORFE department, there must also be a co-adviser who is an ORFE faculty member, and who is seriously involved in co-advising the student.

### PhD Qualifying and General Examinations

The requirements for the PhD degree include passing the qualifying exam requirements, the general examination, a presentation of an acceptable thesis, and passing the final oral examination (thesis defense).

#### Qualifying Examination Procedure

Each student must satisfy qualifying requirements. Qualifying exams are offered in September of the student's second year. Normally, the qualifying exams are oral and administered by 2 ORFE faculty at the rank of Assistant Professor or above.

A student who obtained a grade of A- or better in 4 of the 6 required classes will be exempt from the September qualifying exams. If this is not the case, the student will meet with the DGS to decide which exams need to be taken in September to satisfy the requirements. The optimization exams are based on ORF 522 and ORF 523. The probability exams are based on ORF 526 and ORF 527. The statistics exams are based on ORF 524 and ORF 525.

The results of the qualifying exam are determined by a vote of the faculty. Students who fail must transfer out of the PhD program. There is no option to retake the exam.

#### General Examination Procedure

ORFE students take the general exam in April or May of their second year. By that time, the students have met the qualifying examination requirements, have taken and passed ORF 509, have taken or are currently enrolled in ORF 510 and have passed with a B+ or higher two advanced courses. The student must have shown adequate progress on research and an acceptable level of understanding of his or her area of specialization.

The general exam consists of two parts, a written and an oral part, both covering the student primary area of specialization. The written part requires taking and passing with a B+ or higher two approved advanced courses at the graduate (500) level beyond the 4 core classes counted for the Qualifying Exam. These two courses must be approved by the student's adviser and the DGS.

For each student, an examining committee is selected by the student and adviser. The committee will be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies. Normally, the committee members comprise the students adviser(s) and two additional ORFE faculty or associated faculty. The committee will administer the oral exam, evaluate the student's performance in research and overall knowledge of his/her field, and make a recommendation to the department faculty. A departmental faculty vote determines the final outcome. The oral exam may be up to 3 hours in length.

**Information on the oral exam:** Before the exam, the student is required to submit a comprehensive written report on the research conducted in ORF 509-510. It is due one week before the exam takes place. The report serves as the basis for the student's presentation. The purpose of the presentation is to explain the research the student has done so far and plans to do in the future. Examining faculty may ask questions on the presentation and on any other material deemed appropriate for a comprehensive examination.

The possible outcomes of the general exam are as follows:

A. Student passes the exam and is admitted to Ph.D. candidacy,
B. Student fails the exam but is given the option to retake the exam at a future date,
C. Student fails the exam and must withdraw from the Ph.D. program.

As mentioned earlier, the ORFE faculty will determine the outcome based on the recommendation of the examining committee. In case C, the student is usually given the MA degree and must terminate unless the faculty recommends otherwise. 

### Annual Reenrollment

#### Second Year Reenrollment

Upon passing the general examination, the recommendation for readmission for the next academic year is made by the student's thesis adviser and approved by the department faculty.

#### Research Advising Committee for Ph.D. Candidates

If the thesis adviser plans to recommend against the readmission of the student, an examination committee *must* be formed to determine the progress of the student's work and the recommendation must be made by the committee and approved by the department faculty.

#### Third and Fourth Year Advisory Committee

**Optional** If requested by either the student's thesis adviser, or the student, or the Director of Graduate Studies, an examination committee shall be appointed by the department chair to examine the progress of the student. The committee would be composed of the student\'s adviser plus two other advisory faculty members. The student will present a seminar to this committee describing the proposed area of research, the background work completed in preparing for the research effort, the intended avenues of investigation, specific problems with the work the student feels are likely to cause the most difficulty, and the aspects of the work that will require the most guidance. The purpose of this interchange is to provide the student and the adviser some assistance in assuring that the research proceeds in a fruitful direction.

### Dissertation and Post-Generals Courses

Usually completion of a suitable dissertation takes two to three years beyond the general examination. During those years the student is encouraged to select an area outside his/her specialty and to broaden his/her base of knowledge by enrolling in courses in that area. It is also expected that additional courses will be taken related to the student\'s specialty area. Upon completion and acceptance of the dissertation by the department, the candidate will be admitted to the final public oral (FPO) examination.

### Final Public Oral 

The readers and FPO examiners must be approved first by the ORFE department, and then by the Graduate School. The first reader is the principal adviser, and the second reader is an ORFE faculty member. An FPO examination committee and readers approval request must be submitted to the Department Chair's office. Please submit at least two months before the anticipated FPO date to Connie Brown at connieb@princeton.edu. If any reader is not a Princeton ORFE professor, your request should include a written justification why an external reader is needed, and their current CV. The committee of examiners for the FPO must include no fewer than two current ORFE faculty members, and no fewer than three current Princeton faculty members. If a committee member is not an ORFE faculty member, your request must include written justification why an external committee member is needed, as well as their current CV.

When your committee and readers are approved by the department, you will be notified in writing. You will provide your department-approved list to the Graduate Program Administrator, who will then send it to the Graduate School for approval. Once approved by the Graduate School, you can send your thesis to your readers. After the readers send their completed reports to the Graduate Program Administrator, they will be sent to the Graduate School along with your additional application materials and requested FPO date and time for approval. This must be done at least two weeks prior to the requested FPO date.

## MSE Degree Requirements

The program requires, as a minimum, 10 courses in two years with a master\'s thesis. In particular, ORF 509 and 510 must be taken (and can be included in the required 10 courses). The grade for ORF 510 will be counted as the master thesis grade after an oral examination of the thesis with the student's adviser and another ORFE faculty or associated faculty member. The following is a sample study plan. Make alterations as you deem appropriate, subject to the approvals of your adviser and the Director of Graduate Studies depending on your background and interests.

### Sample Study Plan for MSE

## Other Regulations

### Satisfactory Academic Progress

To establish the foundation for satisfactory academic progress, the Graduate School and academic departments expect the following from enrolled students, as evidence of their successful engagement with graduate work and for them to continue to receive their stipends and other benefits of enrollment:

- Full-time Commitment. Graduate study at Princeton, at both the doctoral and master's levels, requires full-time commitment to study and research on the part of students.

- Presence. Students must be visibly present in the department and on campus, unless *In Absentia* or on an approved Leave of Absence. As importantly, students must be intellectually "present," that is, noticeably engaged in the normal work of their degree program---course-taking, paper-writing, research, teaching, seminar attendance.

- Production. Students must be producing work of good quality, at the appropriate and expected stages of their degree program, and showing the products of their study and research to the faculty for evaluation.

- Communication. Students must regularly communicate with and respond in a timely manner to communications from their department graduate program administrator, director of graduate studies, adviser(s), committee members, and other faculty members as appropriate. This is a reciprocal responsibility and graduate students should therefore expect regular and timely communication in order to maintain satisfactory academic progress.

Failure to perform according to these guidelines may result in, for example, deferred reenrollment or denial of reenrollment during the spring term review or termination at mid-year.

#### Academic Regulations and Fraud

The Graduate School has become increasingly concerned about academic fraud. Please take time to read information on "General Requirements for the Acknowledgment of Sources in Academic Work" and "Definitions of Academic Violations under the Jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline" contained in "Rights, Rules and Responsibilities". Upon entering Princeton, you also received information concerning this important subject. This information is furnished to make you aware of your responsibilities regarding University requirements on acknowledgment of sources and academic fraud. The department joins with the Graduate School in taking a strict stance in this area.

#### Changes in Course Status

Any changes (grading options, dropping or adding courses etc.) that you may need to make to your registered courses, should be discussed with your adviser or DGS prior to making changes. You may change your status in a course no later than two weeks prior to the last day of the regularly scheduled class of the semester. Core Course changes must be approved by DGS in writing.

#### Auditing Courses

1.  Courses selected by pre-Generals and Masters Students must be taken for a letter grade and cannot be audited.
1.  Post-Generals students may sign up for courses as audit.
1.  Post-Generals students may take courses on a pass/fail (P/F) basis with the approval of their adviser and the course instructor.

Generally, courses taken on a P/F basis should be outside of the student's primary area of interest.

#### Assistants in Instruction

Normally, PhD candidates receive appointments as assistant in instruction (AI) beginning their second year. All students are required to attend AI training prior to term. Before an international student can be appointed as an AI, they need: to pass the English Language Program (ELP) test administered by the Graduate School, and to complete any required ELP courses.

#### Part-time Employment

The following employment policy is quoted from the Princeton University Graduate School:

The Graduate School considers employment beyond a maximum full-time assistantship of 20 hours per week incompatible with full-time graduate study.

The Graduate School reviews students' on-campus employment records. Accordingly, the Graduate School can and will disallow part-time employment, excluding all service awards, if that employment does not comply with federal immigration and employment regulations, and/or fellowship policies. The following policies will be applicable:

Under no circumstance can a U. S. student or permanent resident work more than 20 hours per week from all sources (AI, AR and/or hourly employment). Any work beyond a full AI and/or AR appointment may jeopardize the full-time student status of this and other graduate students (with serious tax implications), and will therefore be closely scrutinized.

Under no circumstances can an international student on a visa, with a full AI and/or AR appointment, work even one hour more through hourly employment or otherwise. This not only jeopardizes the full-time student status of this and other graduate students as noted above, but it also violates the terms of the visa status. 

International students may not accept off-campus employment without authorization from either the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the J-1 program sponsor. International students should contact the International Graduate Student Adviser (Office of General Counsel), for further information on employment eligibility.

Historically, in addition to being employed as ARs and AIs by the Department, graduate students have intermittently been involved in employment elsewhere. It is the concern of the Department that, at times, this latter type of employment is neither manageable nor necessary and, in fact, is incompatible with full-time graduate study. Therefore, the Department feels it is important to ensure the awareness of the above employment policy. Included in this policy is consulting projects. All employment other than an AR or AI is subject to review by the Director of Graduate Studies. 

Students must seek approval of part-time employment opportunities by filing a Request for approval from their adviser and the Departmental Director of Graduate Studies.

#### Leave of Absence

Written approval of adviser and DGS are required. Leave of Absence forms are available on the department website under the About Tab, Internal, & Forms.

#### Holiday, Vacation, and Travel

All time away from campus *(except weekends)* must be approved in writing by your adviser and if an Assistant in Instruction, approval from the DGS and course instructor. An email requesting time away from campus with your leave and return date including reason for absence is appropriate. In the case of first year students that may not yet have an adviser, you must submit your request via email through Kim Lupinacci in the Graduate Office who will obtain approvals from the Director of Graduate Studies. 

Graduate study is, understood to be a full-time commitment on the part of students. During an academic year, which includes the summer, graduate student degree candidates may take up to (but no more than) four weeks of vacation, including any days taken during regular University holidays and scheduled recesses (e.g., the fall- and spring- term breaks and inter-term break). The specific periods taken as vacation must not conflict with the student's academic responsibilities, coursework, research, or teaching, and should be discussed in advance with one's director of graduate studies, adviser, or dissertation committee.

If a student receives financial support for graduate study for only part of the year (e.g., regular term time, September 1 to June 30), then the amount of vacation should be prorated accordingly. If a student receives summer support and has taken the allowed vacation during regular term time, September 1 to June 30, then he or she should not take additional vacation time during the summer months of July and August.

If a student holds an external fellowship whose terms may conflict with this guideline, the student should consult first with the director of graduate studies or adviser.

**PLEASE NOTE**

All ORFE Graduate Students are required to be on campus during term time. Any time away from campus exceeding 3 business days MUST BE APPROVED in writing by your adviser or DGS for 1^st^ year students without an adviser. You are responsible for emailing a formal request to Kim Lupinacci in the student affairs office at least **2 weeks prior to leave**. Kim will contact the DGS for approval and confirm with you the decision.

\
TRAVEL-RELATED FUNDING STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE**

Please follow these steps to ensure your travel is considered for all
eligible funding. These steps must be followed at least THREE WEEKS
[prior]{.ul} to departure date.

**Step One:** Consult your adviser about the intended trip, obtain
approval for travel using our Pre-Authorization Form (can pick up in Rm.
102) and request support as applicable. *HINT*: Your adviser's approval
and trip details will be required for all of the remaining steps so it
is a good idea to have the Pre-Authorization form ready when applying
for funding outside of the department.

**Step Two:** Apply for funding through the Graduate School by visiting
the website [here]{.ul} and completing the SAFE application required.

**Step Three:** Apply for funding through the School of Engineering by
visiting the website [here]{.ul} and completing the online form
required.

**Step Four:** Apply for funding through the Department of Operations
Research & Financial Engineering by emailing Kim Lupinacci [here]{.ul}.
Your email must contain your Pre-Authorization Form
[with]{.ul} adviser's signature, list of all funding received to-date
for the trip AND the amount being requested of the department in US
Dollars. 

Starting March 11, 2019, graduate students traveling to locations with
elevated risk will be required to complete an additional review process
that includes receiving a safety and security assessment for their
itinerary from ISOS, the University's provider of emergency and support
services for international travelers (more on ISOS below) and signing a
document acknowledging the risks associated with the travel they plan to
undertake.  You will be notified if your itinerary includes a location
that is deemed to be higher risk.

[Travel Resources]{.ul}

We encourage you to take advantage of the many international travel
resources available to graduate students at Princeton:

**Travel Toolkit --** This link provides Princeton-specific information
and advice to make sure you are well-prepared for international travel:
[https://international.princeton.edu/travel-toolkit]{.ul}.

**University Health Services (UHS)** -- All international travelers are
urged to contact Travel Medicine for pre-departure planning,
immunizations, travel-related prescriptions, education, and post-travel
evaluation of medical problems acquired abroad:
[http://uhs.princeton.edu/medical-services/travel-planning]{.ul}.

**International SOS (ISOS)** -- ISOS provides emergency and support
services for international travelers. All University members on
University-sponsored trips are automatically enrolled in ISOS coverage. 
ISOS is also a resource for local expertise and advice before and while
traveling: [https://travel.princeton.edu/international-sos]{.ul}.

**International Health Insurance --** The University provides
international health coverage to all students with a current passport or
student visa who are temporarily traveling or residing outside of their
country of regular residence as part of a University activity, program,
research, or other sponsored travel.  Coverage is provided by Nationwide
Insurance in conjunction with ISOS. There is no enrollment required and
there is no separate ID card.  One of the benefits of the insurance
coverage is that if a Princeton student contacts ISOS to coordinate the
care and payment of medical care, they will not incur out-of-pocket
payments in most cases.

**Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)** -- Students who are U.S.
citizens must enroll in STEP and request automatic alert updates from
the U.S. State Department on the countries they are visiting:
[https://step.state.gov/step/]{.ul}.  Students who are not U.S. citizens
should register with their government or local embassy if possible.

In closing, we hope that you take full advantage of the international
travel resources available to you at Princeton.  All the best for a
productive semester!
